# Agent Package Manager — Interactive Book

This repository builds an **interactive HTML book** that teaches the
[Agent Package Manager (APM)](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/). The book starts from
**high-level concepts** (dependency management for AI agents, portability across harnesses,
reproducibility, supply-chain security, and governance) and descends into the **APM features** —
the `apm.yml` manifest, the lockfile, primitives, the CLI, and policy — linking each feature back
to the concept it implements. The backend installs the real `apm` CLI so the tool is studied
empirically, not described from memory.

The book is itself produced with the **agentic methodology it teaches**: a team of specialized
Copilot primitives (custom agents + skills + instructions) collaborate in waves of
draft → verify → review → integrate.

## The primitives (the "team")

### Custom agents — `.github/agents/`
| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| `book-architect` | Designs TOC, chapter specs, navigation, and the wave plan |
| `theory-researcher` | Cited concept briefs from APM docs (theory sections) |
| `apm-cli-explorer` | Installs & introspects the `apm` CLI + manifest/lockfile/policy schemas |
| `chapter-author` | Weaves theory + CLI reference into chapter content |
| `code-verifier` | Runs every `apm` example / validates every manifest; reports PASS/FAIL |
| `chapter-reviewer` | Reviews chapters; ACCEPT/REVISE + ranked findings |
| `frontend-builder` | Builds the interactive HTML shell and wires content in |

### Skills — `.github/skills/`
- `book-orchestration` — the wave-based workflow coordinating the whole team.
- `apm-environment-setup` — reproducible install of the `apm` CLI + a sample repo for introspection.

### Instructions — `.github/instructions/`
- `book-content.instructions.md` — content/style/structure/citation rules (`content/**`).
- `apm-examples.instructions.md` — APM manifest/command example conventions (`**/apm*.yml`).

### Prompts — `.github/prompts/`
- `update-book.prompt.md` — check upstream releases and prepare a targeted, reviewed book update;
  no publication by default.
- `release-content.prompt.md` — prepare an edition or explicitly publish its merged commit.
- `run-playbook.prompt.md` — bootstrap the whole book; not the incremental-update entry point.
- `new-chapter.prompt.md` — kick off one chapter end-to-end through the team.

## How they work together
See `.github/skills/book-orchestration/SKILL.md`. In short:
`architect` sets the outline → `frontend-builder` scaffolds the shell → per chapter,
`theory-researcher` + `apm-cli-explorer` research in parallel → `chapter-author` drafts →
`code-verifier` proves the examples → `chapter-reviewer` gates quality → `frontend-builder`
integrates. Work proceeds in waves (pilot chapter first), with a checkpoint commit per chapter.

## Project conventions
- **Concept before command.** Every feature is anchored to a concept introduced first.
- **Verify before ship.** A chapter is done only when its examples PASS (or are clearly marked
  `SKIPPED-needs-network`) and the reviewer returns ACCEPT.
- **No secrets in code.** Host/registry tokens live in a gitignored `.env`; examples avoid live pushes.
- **Version-aware.** Record the inspected `apm` CLI version in research/verification artifacts.
- **Frozen update target.** `content/version.yml` records the book edition and reviewed
  `apm_version`; the root skill lockfile is not the book's upstream baseline. Use one pinned
  executable across an update, and advance the baseline only after the quality gates pass.
- **Prepare before publish.** Updates commit reviewed content locally. Merge/tag/push/release
  require an explicit publication request; never push every local tag.
- **Content ⟂ presentation.** Authors write content; `frontend-builder` owns chrome/nav/theming.
